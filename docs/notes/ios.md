# iOS driver notes

Status of `internal/driver/ios`, the CoreDevice backend, and what step 0 found on a real iPhone. Measured on 2026-11-07 with an iPhone 13 mini (iPhone14,4) on iOS 27.0.1 (24A446), connected by USB to a Mac with macOS 27.2 and Xcode 27.2; the developer disk image was mounted and Developer Mode on. A second pass the same night added element frames through `remoteAXService`, the provider's inspection cache, and touches in video pixels. The third (round three, the next morning) added typing by paste, `Waker` and `Unlocker`, measured the phone over Wi-Fi, and read Calculator's display as its value. The fourth (the evening of 2026-11-07) added iPhones below iOS 27; see "iPhones below iOS 27". The fifth (the night of 2026-11-07) fixed what the field test of 2026.1107.1 found (`docs/notes/field-test-iphone.md`): refs, app ids, pickers, covered rows, SpringBoard's alerts, unlocking, the stream while nobody watches. The sixth (2026-11-08) made Pinky prepare a phone itself, without Xcode; see "Preparing a phone without Xcode".

## Step 0 results

| Item | Result | Numbers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tunnel without root | **Works.** A userspace tunnel in Pinky's own process, next to macOS's CoreDevice tunnel | Tunnel up in 0.25–0.35 s, RSD handshake 0.13–0.15 s, 85 services, MTU 16000 |
| Screen stream | **Works.** HEVC over RTP through the userspace tunnel, depacketized to Annex B | 1136x2464 HEVC Main, up to 60 fps, 1–3 Mbit/s typical (cap 6), first packet 0.6 s after the start request, keyframe 70 ms after a request, 0 packets lost over USB |
| Touch | **Works.** Tap, swipe, long press and raw touches through the universal HID service, on one long-lived session. Raw touches take video pixels; the video is the screen at 1:1 plus black padding | Touch-down to the first changed video frame: 100–131 ms, median 109 ms (still Settings page) |
| Keys | Home **works** (Indigo button event); Back is a left-edge swipe and **works**; Recents returns `unsupported` | |
| Text | **Works for any text**, pasted: the pasteboard is saved, set to the text, Command-V goes through the virtual keyboard, and once the field shows the text the pasteboard is put back. Checked in Settings' search with the Pinyin keyboard active: English, Chinese, emoji, appending, and the pasteboard byte for byte the same afterwards. Without the pasteboard service, keys: printable ASCII, switching a composing keyboard (Pinyin) to the Latin one with Control-Space and back | Paste: 0.26–0.46 s per call (the save 2–70 ms, the paste confirmed in the field 0.1–0.36 s, the restore 25–50 ms), about 1 s for the first call in a session. Keys: 4–5 s for "clock" with the switch |
| Element tree (pass/fail) | **Pass.** Through `remoteAXService`, the service Xcode 27's Device Hub uses: label, role, value and frame for every element on screen, nothing installed on the phone. (The inspector API, the first attempt, gives no frames on iOS 27, as go-ios found on 18.4.1.) | Act, settle, `Observe` in one session: Settings 33–261 ms (12 elements, all with frames), Calculator 340–481 ms (23; it waits for the push that carries the display's number), once 1.07 s, over 18 launches in round three (the second pass had seen 2.2 s and 3.0 s in 2 of 9; they did not come back). Without settling, right after a launch: 0.8–1.6 s, which the phone sets. A walk alone: 0.19 s (Settings), 0.29–0.31 s (Calculator), 0.32 s (home screen). Before, inspector and OCR: 1.35 s for Settings with 13 of 38 elements placed, 0.65–0.70 s for Calculator with 8 of 23, and 13.5 s for the first OCR in a process |
| OCR placement | **Fallback only.** macOS Vision through purego places elements by label when `remoteAXService` fails, and adds text the tree lacks when asked | Vision 0.1–0.4 s per screenshot (13.5 s the first time in a process); 9 of 10, 12 of 13, 18 of 26 elements placed on Settings, Clock, home screen |
| Screenshot | **Works**, two services with fallback | 1125x2436 PNG, 0.35 s (Settings) to 0.6–0.75 s (home screen, 5–7 MB) over USB |
| Wake, lock state | **Partly tested.** The screen's state (CoreDevice's backlight state) and the lock state read right on the awake, unlocked phone, and `Wake` leaves the app in front alone. Waking a dark screen and `Unlock` could not be tried: the side button is off limits, the test phone never turns its screen off by itself, and nobody may type its passcode. Unit tests cover the unlock steps; see "What the owner should try" | Screen state 12 ms |
| Wi-Fi | **Works, but too slow and lossy to be the default.** The same tunnel, video, HID, `remoteAXService` and pasteboard run through usbmuxd's network connection | See "Wi-Fi" below: screenshots 3.4–5.3 s, walks 1.7–2.3 s, 1.5–10 % of video packets lost |
| Windows and Linux | **Not tested.** The package cross-compiles without cgo for both | |

What these mean for the design:

- The userspace tunnel removes the "tunnel may need administrator rights" prerequisite on every OS: no utun, no wintun, no sudo. It still needs usbmuxd (built into macOS; Apple Devices on Windows; the `usbmuxd` package on Linux).
- The element tree, the part step 0 feared, works without WebDriverAgent: `remoteAXService` gives frames, and the phone even pushes the whole visible tree after every change, so `Observe` after an action usually costs tens of milliseconds. It needs `clientNeedsAccessibility`, which turns on the phone's accessibility runtime for the session (Device Hub does the same). OCR stays as the fallback.
- USB matters: an iPhone that also syncs over Wi-Fi is listed twice by usbmuxd, and a tunnel over Wi-Fi is several times slower and loses video packets (see "Wi-Fi"). The driver picks the USB entry; Wi-Fi works but stays off by default.

## What is built

`internal/driver/ios` implements `driver.Provider`, `driver.Device`, `driver.Toucher`, `driver.LockReporter`, `driver.Settler`, `driver.Waker` and `driver.Unlocker` on iOS 27. Below iOS 27, `WDADevice` implements `driver.Device`, `driver.Toucher`, `driver.LockReporter` and `driver.Settler`, and `AXDevice` `driver.Device`, `driver.LockReporter` and `driver.Settler` (see "iPhones below iOS 27").

| File | What |
| --- | --- |
| `tunnel.go` | Userspace CoreDevice tunnel: the `CoreDeviceProxy` lockdown service carries bare IPv6 packets; a gVisor netstack (TCP and UDP) runs them in-process. go-ios dials services through a 127.0.0.1 forwarder that speaks go-ios's userspace-tunnel preamble and only reaches the device's tunnel address |
| `conn.go` | Tunnel plus RSD handshake. The first handshake announces the host (`HandshakeAsHost`), once per tunnel, as iOS 27.2 requires |
| `coredevice.go` | CoreDevice RemoteXPC requests, always with protocol 629.3 / DDI version 2 (some features refuse the old version), with dial and request timeouts |
| `offer.go`, `display.go` | The media stream offer (adapted from go-ios, MIT) and start/stop. Payload type 100's feature list is `FLS;SW:1;` instead of Xcode's `FLS;VRAE:0;SW:1;`: VRAE:0 makes the encoder drop frames under motion (pymobiledevice3's measurement) |
| `rtp.go`, `sps.go` | RTP parsing; RFC 7798 HEVC (single NAL, AP, FU; PACI skipped) and RFC 6184 H.264 (single, STAP-A, FU-A) depacketizers; the codec is sniffed from the NAL header because payload type 100 carries HEVC. The display service's 14-byte slice trailer is stripped. SPS parsers for the picture size |
| `media.go` | The long-lived stream: access-unit assembly, `driver.Packet`s (a config packet before each keyframe, PTS from the 24 kHz RTP clock), RTCP receiver reports every second (the device stops after 10 s without them), a per-frame receipt like Xcode's, picture loss indications when a subscriber needs a keyframe (repeated every 600 ms until one comes), loss handling, fan-out to `Stream` subscribers |
| `hid.go`, `keys.go` | Universal HID touch reports (surface 257), Indigo button events (Home), a virtual HID keyboard registered with `createService`, ASCII to US-layout usages |
| `pasteboard.go`, `type.go` | The pasteboard service (PULL and SET); `Type` by paste with the pasteboard saved and put back, and the keys fallback with the Latin keyboard switch |
| `power.go` | `Waker` (screen state from the backlight, Home) and `Unlocker` |
| `device.go`, `idle.go` | The session: one tunnel, and one media stream with its HID connection while anyone watches or Pinky sends input; taps and swipes in screenshot pixels and raw touches in video pixels, mapped to the panel's 0..65535 range |
| `axp.go`, `rax.go`, `observe_rax.go` | `remoteAXService`: a keyed-archive reader and writer for AccessibilityPlatformTranslation's classes, the session (requests one at a time, the walk, the trees the phone pushes, what walks told of each element), and `Observe` from it (pushed tree or walk, roles, labels, frames in pixels, other processes' elements, the keyboard, what covers the app) |
| `appid.go` | The app on screen: by process, by name, and beneath Face ID's prompt and other system UI |
| `springboard.go` | SpringBoard's alerts and banners over the app, as events |
| `capture.go` | Elements the screenshot does not show (`not_in_screenshot`) |
| `ax.go`, `caption.go`, `observe.go` | The fallback: the inspector walk, caption parsing into label, role and states, OCR placement, keyboard detection, the foreground app |
| `ocr.go`, `ocr_darwin.go`, `ocr_other.go` | Vision text recognition through purego (no cgo); other OSes return `unsupported` |
| `screenshot.go`, `apps.go`, `lock.go`, `settle.go`, `provider.go`, `display_info.go` | The rest of the interface |
| `diag.go`, `cmd/iosctl` | Diagnostics and the debugging command |
| `version.go` | Which way to drive a phone, by its iOS version |
| `wda.go`, `wda_observe.go`, `wda_device.go`, `wda_run.go`, `replaytouch.go` | The WebDriverAgent path (iOS 17.4 to 26): the HTTP client over usbmuxd, its tree as elements, the device, starting the runner's test, the mirror's touches played back as gestures |
| `ax_device.go` | The accessibility path (iOS 17.4 to 26, nothing installed) |
| `ddi.go`, `mount.go`, `prepare.go`, `host.go` | Preparing a phone without Xcode: finding the developer disk image on the computer, mounting it, the Developer Mode switch, pairing on Windows, the background jobs and the steps in `Info.Setup`, and what the computer lacks (usbmuxd) |
| `framestream.go`, `mjpeg.go`, `h264_darwin.go`, `h264_other.go`, `settle_frames.go` | Frames (JPEG from WDA, screenshots) to H.264 through VideoToolbox, for the mirror and the recorder, and settling by them |

Coordinates are screenshot pixels: 1125x2436 on an iPhone 13 mini, which is the size UIKit renders (375x812 points at 3x); the panel is 1080x2340 and the video 1136x2464. `Toucher` points are video pixels (the contract since 5e83552). Matching decoded frames against screenshots (row and column brightness profiles, correlation 0.998 and better on Settings and Calculator) showed the video is the screen at 1:1 in the top-left corner with black padding, 11 columns on the right and 28 rows at the bottom, so a video point is the same screen point and `Touch` only clamps points in the padding to the screen's edge. A video smaller than the screen would be scaled back up; no phone tested does that.

### Decisions

- **One media stream while anyone watches or Pinky sends input.** HID input is dropped unless a stream from the same client runs, so `Open` starts the stream; `Stream` returns a subscriber view that starts at a fresh keyframe, and closing it does not stop the device's stream. While it runs, iOS tells apps the screen is shared (`UIScreen.isCaptured`), shows the screen-sharing indicator and keeps the camera and microphone from apps, and some banking apps refuse to run (DBS digibank, China Merchants Bank; field test item 5). So the stream stops after 30 s with no view open (the mirror, a task's recording) and no input, and the next view or input starts it again: 0.8 s measured, for a Home press. Restarting streams often can wedge the device's media daemon until a reboot (pymobiledevice3 reports it); a task's recording keeps a view open, so the stream rarely stops in the middle of one.
- **Own display, HID and CoreDevice clients on top of go-ios's transport** instead of go-ios's `display` and `hid` packages: go-ios discards the stream answer (SSRCs and the RTCP port, needed for receiver reports), refuses userspace tunnels for media, and its HID package has no buttons or keyboard.
- **go-ios from main** (`v1.3.3-0.20261103131045-6910f3b585ad`): the display and HID packages and the RSD host announcement are not in a release yet. Pin a release once one has them.
- **HID timestamps in 24 MHz ticks.** go-ios and pymobiledevice3 stamp reports in nanoseconds. With those, a 12 ms key press opened the press-and-hold accent menu (as if held for half a second) and swallowed the rest of the text; stamping in 24 MHz ticks, the phone's mach time unit, fixed it. So the phone reads mach ticks and nanoseconds make every interval look 41.7 times longer. Touch looked fine only because paging goes by distance; fling velocities were affected too.
- **Element frames from `remoteAXService`, the inspector and OCR as the fallback.** See "remoteAXService" below. `Observe` falls back when the service fails to connect or answer, and tries it again after 30 s.
- **A pushed tree when it is recent, else a walk.** The phone builds and pushes the screen's tree after every change, and requests wait while it does (1–4 s on screens with many images), so a walk right after an action is slow. `Observe` walks and waits for the push at once and takes whichever comes first. A push counts only if its first tree arrived at least 1 s after Pinky's last input or launch, the Observe comes within 6 s of that input, and the push's app is the frontmost app the walk's first request found: a push can arrive late, after the next input, and then describes the screen before it (a regression run caught a late home-screen push answering for Settings before this rule). After 6 s the walk alone answers, because the screen may have changed in ways the phone does not push (a timer's text).
- **Roles from AutomationType.** The walk and the second push give `XCUIElementType` (`Key` 20, `Icon` 44, `Cell` 75, `PickerWheel` 39, ...), the same types XCUITest reports. A first push lacks it; then traits and the translator's own role decide (`AXPAttributeRole` 2 button, 3 switch, 4 container or status bar item, 6 heading, 7 image, 9 a tab of iOS 27's floating tab bar, 13 adjustable, 14 static text, 15 text and search fields, as seen). The tab role makes a tab whatever the type (the floating tab bar lists its items as buttons, outside any tab bar, with a value of 0 or 1 that is not shown); the adjustable trait (picker wheels, sliders, the home screen's page pill) adds the state `adjustable`. An element's value reads as its value description when it has one: a picker wheel's value is its row's index in a long looping list ("5003"), the description the row ("12 o’clock"; field test item 22).
- **First pushes only with elements walks have described.** A first push lacks every element's type and identifier, containers' included, so a read from it gave elements other roles, ids and ancestry than the next read, and so new refs (field test item 13: Ethena's nav bar 55 <-> 77, Clock's Delete Alarm button -> text). The session remembers each element's type and identifier by its object ID, which is the same in pushes, walks and later sessions, from every walk and second push, and fills them into first pushes. A first push with an element no walk or second push has described is not used: the read waits for the second push (0.55–0.65 s after the first, on Clock) or the walk. Checked: 12 of 12 elements of Settings kept their refs from a read of a push to a read of a walk.
- **Covered elements are left out.** Elements whose middle lies under the keyboard (its keys' box), iOS 27's floating tab bar (its tabs' box with a 6 pt margin, down to the bottom edge, where the home indicator is) or an alert or banner SpringBoard shows over the app are left out, or keep only the part left uncovered when that is at least a quarter of them, as Android's companion does for windows above an app: a tap by ref goes to the middle of the bounds (field test item 23: a swipe on a row behind the tab bar switched tabs).
- **Roles from captions on the fallback path.** The audit daemon answers attribute queries (label, value, traits) only for the element holding the inspector focus, which would cost a round trip per element on top of the move. The walk keeps its moves pipelined and parses VoiceOver's caption ("Alarms, Button, Selected, Tab") with English and Simplified Chinese trait words; other languages get the whole caption as the label and the role `other`.
- **The provider asks a phone again only when needed.** The gateway lists devices every 2 s. `List` keeps each phone's answer until usbmuxd's entry for it changes (a new `DeviceID` on every attach) or, for a phone that is not online, for 30 s; an inspection cut short by its context is not kept. `Open` reuses the answer and refuses a phone reachable only over Wi-Fi unless `Wireless` is set.
- **Foreground app from the elements.** The frontmost application's process id (on the inspector path, an element handle's first four bytes) goes through the process list (`listprocesses`, its executable URL decoded) and the installation proxy's bundle paths to a bundle id and name. A process the catalog does not list reads the catalog again once (an app installed since); one that is no app is not looked up again for 30 s; a failed lookup falls back to the catalog by the element's label when one app has that name (field test item 27: the first read of a session said "Plasma One" without its id, and blocking goes by id). `Open` reads the catalog in the background.
- **The app beneath system UI.** While Face ID's prompt or its fade-out is in front of an app, the frontmost application is SpringBoard or a process with no name, while the screen still shows the app (field test item 14: OCR read Trust's balances under "Home Screen"). When the frontmost process is not an app from the home screen and the phone is not locked, the read names the app the system has in the foreground: one the inspector session saw come to the foreground since the last read that named the app in front, else that app, unless the daemon said since that it left; SpringBoard with its icons on screen is the home screen. On iOS 27 the inspector's app monitoring sends no states when it turns on, only changes after that, and it reports apps iOS wakes in the background (China Merchants Bank, seen while Settings was in front) in the foreground too, hence the rules; `Open` connects the inspector session for it. Turning monitoring off and on again does not list the apps again (it only empties the states).
- **Screenshots from the instruments service first**, CoreDevice's screen capture second. Both got stuck on the device at times (most likely after a test process was killed mid-request); the fallback and dial timeouts keep calls from hanging.
- **Lock state from lockdown's `PasswordProtected`**, the value `devicectl` reports as `passcodeRequired`. iOS 27's developer disk image does not implement CoreDevice's `getlockstate` (the feature is listed but `dtdeviceinfod` has no implementation).
- **Typing pastes** (the owner's decision). `Type` saves the pasteboard, sets it to the text, presses Command-V on the virtual keyboard, waits until the focused field's value changes (read through `remoteAXService`: the frontmost app's focused element, attribute 19, then its value), and puts the pasteboard back. It chooses before touching the field, so text it cannot type leaves the field as it was. Restoring waits for the paste because restoring first would paste the person's own clipboard into the field (and show it to the agent); without `remoteAXService` it waits 0.5 s. What is saved stays in memory for one call and is never logged or shown; `TypeStats` says only how it went.
- **Pinky's pasteboard writes stay on the phone.** The phone's daemon (the DDI's `dtpasteboardd`) writes with `UIPasteboard setItemProviders:localOnly:expirationDate:` and passes `localOnly` exactly when the SET carries `sourceMetadata` (disassembled from the DDI's `CoreDeviceUtilities`: `localOnly = sourceMetadata != nil`, the branch that also records "sync metadata"). pymobiledevice3 sends none, so its writes go out through Universal Clipboard and replace the clipboards of the owner's Mac and iPad. Pinky always sends `{nonce, pasteboardName, changeCount}`. Checked: the Mac's pasteboard change count (a number; its contents were never read) stayed the same through every write.
- **What the pasteboard keeps.** `Type` reads each item's first representation (`promiseSecondary`, always quick), then all of them (`allResolved`) for up to 3 s; if that read stalls (an app listing a type it cannot produce makes the daemon stall for about 64 s, pymobiledevice3 found with Notes) it keeps the first representations. The daemon refuses to read an item marked as coming from another device through Universal Clipboard (`com.apple.is-remote-clipboard`), a password (`org.nspasteboard.ConcealedType`) or transient (`org.nspasteboard.TransientType`, `de.petermaurer.TransientPasteboardType`, `org.nspasteboard.AutoGeneratedType`), with CoreDeviceError 26006; such a pasteboard cannot be saved, so `Type` empties it after pasting instead of leaving the text there. The test phone held a Universal Clipboard item when this round started. A pasteboard that changed since Pinky's own SET (someone copied, or a Universal Clipboard item arrived) is left as it is.
- **Keys only without the pasteboard service**: printable ASCII through the virtual keyboard. Before typing, a probe letter (deleted again) shows whether the active keyboard composes: Pinyin puts a candidate bar into the app's own tree (cells whose identifier is the candidate, "啊"), sometimes only after a few hundred milliseconds, so the probe looks for up to 1 s. If it composes, Control-Space switches to the other keyboard for the text and back afterwards, 300 ms after the last key (switching back at once let Pinyin take the English word just typed into a composition, "Cloc k", in one run); if the other keyboard composes too, the call returns `unsupported`. Latin keyboards capitalize the first letter of a field (the hardware keyboard's Auto-Capitalization setting), which keys cannot avoid; pasting is not affected. `TypeStats.Trace` records the probes.
- **Waking with Home, never the side button.** The screen's state is CoreDevice's display info `backlightState`: `activeOn` and `activeDimmed` count as on, `off` and `inactiveOn` (the always-on display of newer phones) as asleep. `Wake` does nothing on a screen that is on: Home would leave the app.
- **Unlocking.** `Unlock` wakes the screen, returns at once if lockdown says the phone is unlocked, gives a screen that just lit up 0.5 s, swipes up from the bottom edge, and waits up to 3 s for the passcode pad (buttons for all ten digits, or a secure field for an alphanumeric passcode; it also stops there if Face ID unlocks the phone). Without the pad it swipes again, up to three times, waking the screen again if it went dark: a lock screen with notifications took the first swipe for its notification list once (field test item 17), and a swipe types nothing. Without the pad after that it returns `ErrPINNotEntered` having typed nothing. It types the passcode on the virtual keyboard 120 ms per key, checking before each key that lockdown still says locked (once it does not, the keys would go to the app in front), presses Return unless the passcode is four or six digits (those submit themselves), and waits up to 4 s for lockdown to say unlocked, else `ErrLocked`. It never types the passcode twice.
- **Dropped connections are dialled again.** The phone closes service connections at times: when it locks in a long session (deviceinfo, which waking and unlocking use; field test item 9) and after the pasteboard service sat idle (item 6). A CoreDevice request that fails drops its connection and the next one dials again (`cdService`); `ScreenOn` retries once at once, and `Type` reads the pasteboard a second time on a new connection before giving up. When the pasteboard service is there but still does not answer, `Type` says to try again instead of `unsupported`: the agent in the field test took "unsupported" to mean the iPhone can only type English.
- **A locked phone that cannot be read reads as locked.** A locked phone can stop answering accessibility requests, and the inspector walk then times out too (field test item 9). When `remoteAXService` fails and lockdown says locked, `Observe` returns a locked screen with no elements, so the agent hands the phone over instead of failing.
- **SpringBoard's alerts and banners are events.** They are not in the frontmost app's tree (field test item 7: a timer that went off showed only as OCR fragments). SpringBoard's application element answers whichever app is in front (request type 1 with its pid); while an app is in front its children are the status bar's items, which carry trait bit 23, and what SpringBoard draws over the app. Each read looks at them in the background, and each overlay becomes one event while it stays: an alert (`Alert`/`Dialog` type) a `dialog` event, whose elements are listed too so that an agent can press its buttons; anything else with a button a `notification` event, with the bundle id of the app it names first when one app has that name; the rest a `toast` event. Notifications are never listed as elements, so their text reaches agents only through the gateway's masking of codes. Only the phone's quiet screens were checked (no false events in Settings, Clock and the home screen): no banner or alert could be raised during the test, so their shape in SpringBoard's tree is not confirmed.
- **Elements the screenshot does not show.** Some apps draw part of their screen in a layer iOS leaves out of screenshots, recordings and mirroring (field test item 21: Trust's passcode keypad was in the tree and blank in the mirror). A read with OCR compares its screenshot with the tree: when at least three labelled elements cover areas of one flat color (every pixel or two sampled), with no OCR text in them, they carry the state `not_in_screenshot`; reads without a screenshot keep what the last such read of the app found, so an element's states do not change with the kind of read. No false marks on the home screen, Settings, Clock and Calculator (whose thin operator symbols a sparse grid missed at first); the keypad itself is covered by unit tests only (banking apps are off limits).
- **Wi-Fi stays off by default.** See "Wi-Fi" below. `Open` uses the USB entry unless `Info.Connection` is "wifi".
- **Values in identifiers.** Calculator's display has no label or value, only the identifier `StandardInputView;value:144`. An identifier with `;value:` gives its name as the identifier (stable, for refs) and the rest as the value, and such an element reads as text, so the display is `text "144"`.

## How to run

```

`iosctl unlock` reads a passcode from standard input and unlocks: only for the owner (see "What the owner should try").

`iosctl devices` lists every phone usbmuxd sees and opens a tunnel to each to check its services, so do not run it while other sessions use their phones. Keep captures under `/tmp/pinky-*` and delete them afterwards.

`iosctl observe` prints where the tree came from (`remoteax`, `remoteax-push` or `inspector`) and the timings; `ObserveStats.Trace` says what the remoteax path waited for. `iosctl type` prints how it typed (paste or keys) and what happened to the pasteboard, never the text. Each `iosctl` command is a new process with no earlier input, so it always walks; the device tests below measure the push path.

Tests: `go test ./internal/driver/ios/` runs the unit tests (RTP and SPS parsing, depacketizers, access-unit assembly, the offer against a captured one, the keyed-archive reader and writer, trees from pushes, elements and roles from the tree including other processes and the keyboard, caption parsing, keyboard detection, OCR placement, HID reports, the provider's cache, video-to-screen points) without a phone. The real-phone tests share one session and use only the home screen, Settings, Calculator and Clock:

```sh
PINKY_DEVICE=<udid> scripts/devlock.sh <udid> go test -tags device -count=1 -v ./internal/driver/ios/
```

All 16 pass on the iPhone 13 mini (inspect, stream, home screen observe, swipe and raw touch, apps, launch Settings by name, Calculator tap, screenshot, lock state, unsupported keys, latency, typing by paste into Settings' search with the pasteboard checked after each call, typing by keys with the keyboard switch, waking, a Calculator key tapped where Observe puts it and the display read back as `7`, Observe timing after launches). `TestDeviceConnection` measures one connection in a session of its own: `PINKY_CONN=usb` or `wifi`, run alone with `-run TestDeviceConnection`. `PINKY_NO_SETTLE=1` makes the timing test observe right after each launch; `PINKY_SHOTS=1` saves the typing test's screenshots under `/tmp/pinky-ios` (delete them afterwards).

## Details and data

### Tunnel

- The device gives each tunnel its own /64 (macOS's own tunnel was `fd3e:…`, ours `fd4f:…`), so both coexist. macOS 27's own tunnel is not routable from other processes (no utun route), so Pinky cannot borrow it.
- The device grants the MTU asked for (16000), which keeps per-packet overhead low. Over USB a 6.9 MB screenshot arrives in about 0.75 s including the phone's PNG encoding, so the userspace stack moves at least 9 MB/s; gVisor's TCP receive autotuning is on.
- Sending the device much data needs a small MTU. With 16000, the first full-size packets of an upload (the developer disk image) went out and the device then sent nothing more on the tunnel, not even their ACKs: the tunnel's counters stopped, gVisor retransmitted with backoff, and 18 s later the device's TCP gave up ("Operation timed out", 2026-11-08, iOS 27.0.1). The tunnel that mounts the image asks for 1280 (`uploadMTU`), as go-ios's tunnels do; the image then goes over in half a second. Other tunnels keep 16000: their packets to the device are small.
- `HandshakeAsHost` once per tunnel matters: without the host's RemoteXPC version flags, services that send large replies (screenshots) crash on the device, and cryptexd logs "Invalid or missing remote device connection version flags". The phone takes the announcement only once it has settled TLS on that RSD connection; closing the connection right after sending it lost it on about half of the tunnels ("Device must renegotiate TLS"). The connection now stays open for 2 s (`rsdLinger`), and every tunnel got its flags.

### Video

- The answer's `streamConfig`: `RxPayloadType` 100 (HEVC inside), `Framerate` 60, `KeyFrameInterval` 0 (no periodic keyframes), `RXMaxBitrate` 6000000, `RTCPTimeoutEnabled` with 10 s, `CustomWidth`x`CustomHeight` 1136x2448 while the SPS says 1136x2464 (the SPS is right; ffprobe agrees).
- The phone also creates a virtual "Wireless" display (id 2, 1136x2448) for the stream.
- RTCP is multiplexed on the receiver port; the phone sends a sender report about every second. Its NTP time against our arrival gives 55–95 ms one way, if both clocks agree.
- After a change the phone sends 60 fps for about 5–7 s, then stops sending frames until the screen changes again (a status bar clock tick restarts them); its RTCP sender reports keep coming every second throughout. While frames do come, a still screen gives identical frame sizes and motion varying ones (5–75 KB). The size of a still frame depends on the encoder's current bitrate: about 1–2 KB when idle, but after motion the encoder raises its bitrate and pads still frames to a constant 10 KB for seconds. So "no frames, or frames of one size" marks a still screen, not small frames; the settle detector uses that (step 0 item 4). The stream's watchdog counts RTCP too: only silence on both for 5 s means the phone stopped the stream.
- A subscriber that joins while frames have stopped gets the parameter sets and a fresh keyframe within about 25 ms of its request.
- Settle data from Settings: tapping "General" changed the first frame 331 ms after touch-down (the tap is held 60 ms, so about 270 ms after touch-up, including the app's own response); the push animation's frames were 58–74 KB; frame sizes became constant about 2.3 s after the tap. A fling in a list keeps the picture moving for about 2.5 s (measured as frame-to-frame pixel difference in the decoded video). Home screens with widgets (Photos, Clock) never look still.
- The audit daemon's screen and layout change notifications arrived in one session and not in others, so they are only a hint for settling.
- Without loss there are no keyframes after the first. Subscribers that join later ask for one; the phone ignores a request that comes right after a keyframe, hence the retry.
- Packet loss happened only over Wi-Fi and while large screenshots shared the tunnel; the gVisor UDP buffer never overflowed.

### Input

- Touch positions are 0..65535 on each axis of the panel in its native (portrait) orientation. Landscape is not handled yet: the mapping assumes `rot0`.
- `Key(back)` swipes from the left edge at mid-height over 250 ms. It starts at x=0 so the system gesture wins; a stray drag cannot select anything, but avoid screens where a drag at mid-height matters.
- The virtual keyboard makes iOS treat the phone as having a hardware keyboard while the session lasts; the software keyboard still showed in Settings until a key was pressed. It is registered at the first key, not at `Open` (registering takes about 0.35 s), and goes away when the HID connection closes. `Type` without `Append` sends Command-A and Delete first.
- Keys go through the active input method. On the test phone the Pinyin keyboard was active: "clock" typed as keys became a composition (Command-A did not select it, one Delete left "c lo c" with U+2006 spaces between the syllables), and Escape appeared to cancel it. That is why `Type` pastes (the owner's choice between pasting and switching keyboards); keys remain only as the fallback above. Command-V and Command-A work with Pinyin active as long as nothing is being composed.

### Pasteboard

- The service: `com.apple.coredevice.pasteboardservice` (DDI `dtpasteboardd`, launchd label `com.apple.coredevice.dtpasteboardd`, entitlement `com.apple.private.CoreDevice.canAccessPasteboard`), bare XPC dictionaries with `command`, replies on the server-to-client stream; requests need the wants-reply flag. Messages: `PULL {pasteboardName, dataPolicy}` → `PULL_REPLY {pasteboard: {items, metadata, sourceMetadata}}`; `SET {pasteboardName, items, sourceMetadata}` → `SET_REPLY` with the new snapshot. Items are `{types: [UTI], data: {UTI: {data}}}`; a promised representation comes as `{isPromised, isAvailable, size}`. Metadata is `{nonce (the phone's boot session), pasteboardName, changeCount}`, and a PULL returns the `sourceMetadata` of the SET that made the current contents, so Pinky can tell its own write.
- Errors come as `{error: {code, domain, userInfo}}` (CoreDeviceError). 26006: "The pasteboard contains type '…' indicating its contents are transient, confidential, or already synchronized by another mechanism, and was not synchronized."
- `SET` with no items empties the pasteboard. Timings over USB: the first request on a connection 0.55 s (the RemoteXPC handshake; `Open` now connects the service in the background), then PULL 2–35 ms, SET 8–30 ms.
- No paste permission prompt or banner appeared: Command-V from a keyboard counts as the person's paste.

### Keyboards

- The test phone's language is English (Singapore); lockdown's `com.apple.international` `Keyboard` names the default keyboard (`en_GB@sw=QWERTY;hw=Automatic`), not the active one, which was Pinyin (Simplified Chinese).
- With Pinyin active, a typed letter shows a candidate bar in the app's own tree (`Cell` elements labelled "啊, 叹词的啊" with the identifier "啊", and a "More suggestions" button). `AXPAttributeTextInputMarkedRange` (123) answered nothing; the field's value shows the uncommitted letters.
- Control-Space switched Pinyin to English (UK) and back; two presses restore the keyboard. After hardware key presses iOS hides the on-screen keyboard until the field is tapped again. A probe's walk right after a switch took 1.1–1.8 s (the phone was pushing a tree).

### Wi-Fi

With Finder's "Show this iPhone when on Wi-Fi", usbmuxd lists the phone twice (USB and Network). Opening the Network entry runs everything Pinky uses: the tunnel (CoreDeviceProxy through usbmuxd's network connection), video, HID, `remoteAXService`, screenshots and the pasteboard. The same session measured over each (`TestDeviceConnection`, two Wi-Fi runs):

| | USB | Wi-Fi |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Session open | 0.58 s | 1.5–2.6 s |
| Touch-down to changed frame | 73–154 ms | 6 ms–1.5 s (median 150–270 ms) |
| Observe, walk | 0.3 s (pushes 32–38 ms) | 1.7–2.3 s |
| Screenshot (home screen) | 0.67–0.78 s | 3.4–5.3 s |
| Type (paste) | 0.26–0.46 s | about 2 s |
| Video | 0 packets lost, no keyframe requests | 1.5–10 % of packets lost, 10–27 keyframe requests in 55 s |

Everything goes through TCP inside TCP over Wi-Fi (gVisor's TCP in the tunnel, inside usbmuxd's connection), so each round trip costs tens of milliseconds and a walk, which is one round trip per request, pays it 25–40 times; the video is UDP in the tunnel and the phone drops it when the tunnel backs up. So `Provider.Wireless` stays off: the mirror would stutter, agents would wait seconds per step, and turning it on would also make the gateway open every iPhone and iPad paired over Wi-Fi (the owner's iPad among them) and show screen sharing on them. Apple's own Wi-Fi path is a different tunnel (remote pairing over QUIC, pymobiledevice3's `remote start-tunnel` over Wi-Fi), not tried here; it is the way to make Wi-Fi good.

### Element tree (inspector, the fallback)

- The walk: `deviceInspectorFocusOnElement:` then `deviceInspectorMoveWithOptions:` (first, then next) in batches of 8, until an element repeats; it covers the visible app including off-screen cells of scroll views (Settings lists all 38 rows, only the visible ones get positions), but not the keyboard (another process) or the status bar. It does not scroll the app.
- Per element: caption (label, value, traits, hint as VoiceOver speaks them), accessibility identifier, an opaque handle. Captions are localized.
- Tried for frames on iOS 27, all empty: attributes `Frame`, `AXFrame`, `frame`, `accessibilityFrame`, `Bounds`, `Position`, `Size`, `ElementRect`, `AXAttribute-2003` and more; hit testing (`deviceFetchElementAtNormalizedDeviceCoordinate:` with an `NSValue` point) answers nothing; `deviceFetchSpecialElement:` 0 and 1 return the first and last element, not the app. The audit (`deviceBeginAuditTypes:`) reports rects only for flagged elements (8 "element detection" issues on the home screen, 3.9 s).
- Side effect found and fixed: the inspector focus draws a ring on the focused element (visible in the video) until `deviceInspectorPreviewOnElement:` is sent with null, which every walk now does.
- A null element handle in `deviceElement:valueForAttribute:` broke the daemon connection; never send one.

### remoteAXService

How it was found: Xcode's `AccessibilityAudit.framework` (in `Xcode.app/Contents/SharedFrameworks`) holds both ends. On the host, `AXAuditRemoteDevice` owns the DTX connection and serves as the transport of an `AXPHostCacheManager` (from the system's `AccessibilityPlatformTranslation.framework`): it sends what the manager hands it with `processDataFromHost:` and feeds what the phone sends through `processDataFromRemoteDevice:` back to it. On the phone, `AXAuditDevicesAppRemoteServer` does the reverse for the phone's `AXPTranslator_iOS`. The Objective-C runtime (through purego) listed the classes and methods, lldb disassembled the few methods that mattered, Apple's own `NSKeyedArchiver` showed the request format, and `AXPTranslatorRequest`'s `description` named the attribute numbers.

The protocol, as iOS 27.0.1 speaks it:

- DTX on the tunnel (`com.apple.accessibility.axAuditDaemon.remoteAXService`), global channel only. Send `_notifyOfPublishedCapabilities:`; `deviceAPIVersion` answers 26.
- `clientNeedsAccessibility:` with YES is required: without it requests get no answer. NO makes the phone close the connection, so it means goodbye. The phone then asks the host `hostAPIVersion` (Xcode answers 7, and so does Pinky).
- A request is an `NSKeyedArchiver` archive (secure coding) of `AXPTranslatorRequest` {`requestType`, `attributeType`, `actionType`, `clientType` (Xcode's cached-tree client type, 2), `parameters`, `translation` (`AXPTranslationObject` {`pid`, `objectID`, `isApplicationElement`, ...})}, sent as the `NSData` argument of `processDataFromHost:`. The answer comes as `processDataFromRemoteDevice:` with an archived `AXPTranslatorResponse` {`associatedRequestType`, `attribute`, `resultData`, `associatedTranslationObject`, `notification`, `error`}.
- Request types used: 2 one attribute (`attributeType`), 4 the frontmost app's element (18–19 ms), 5 several attributes with `parameters` {`attributes`: [numbers]} (the key `AXPAttributes` gives an empty answer). 11 is the tree dump the phone pushes; asked for by the host, it got no answer.
- Answers carry no request ID, so requests go one at a time: 5–60 ms each when the phone is idle, about 10 ms per element in a walk. A request for all 131 attributes at once got no answer within 2 s; a session with a request that timed out is dropped, since its late answer would be read as the next one's.
- Attribute numbers (from the description on macOS 27; the walk asks for the marked ones): 1 activation point, 3 attributed label, 8 children*, 9 children in navigation order*, 21 frame* (screen points), 23 help, 25 identifier*, 26 is element*, 27 enabled*, 28 focused*, 30 selected*, 32 visible*, 33 label*, 41 parent, 42 placeholder*, 45 role*, 53 value*, 61 automation type* (`XCUIElementType`), 62 image data (PNG), 64 value description*, 65 host application pid*, 66 is remote element*, 69 remote element pid*, 77 traits*, 78 traits as text, 112 visible point, 114 braille frame, 124 responds to interaction, 128 memory address, 129 application orientation.
- Pushes: after `clientNeedsAccessibility` and after screen changes, 1.1–1.5 s later, the phone pushes `AXPTreeDumpTypeInitialDump` (the frontmost app's element and every element on screen with about 24 attributes: 21 KB for Settings, 36 KB for Calculator, 32 KB for the home screen), then `AXPTreeDumpTypeAdditionalData` (the same elements with about 60 attributes, AutomationType, identifiers and icon images included: 68 KB, 134 KB and 1.7 MB) and sometimes notifications. Not every change gets a push (Calculator's Clear did not). Decoding takes 0.3–4.5 ms.
- While the phone builds a push, requests wait. Walks measured 0.27–0.33 s on an idle Calculator and 1.08 s when one met a push; on screens whose second push carries many images, 2.9 s (home screen) and 4.6 s (Settings' search with the keyboard up). Hence the push rules above.
- What is listed: the elements on screen, in reading order (12–14 on Settings' first page, where the inspector walk found 38 rows including those scrolled out of view; 23–25 on Calculator; 26 on the home screen). Elements behind a sheet can be listed too (Settings' rows under its search suggestions).
- Other processes: the keyboard's keys (another process) come as children of the app, with frames relative to a host view listed just before them, which has traits bit 34 (`0x400000000`) and the keyboard's frame; the keys are `StaticText` labelled with one character. A home screen widget (Photos, another process) came with a frame relative to itself and no host; `Observe` leaves such elements out rather than place them wrongly. Attributes 66 and 69 stayed empty in both cases. A web page in an app is another process too (Yahoo!'s news list on an iPhone 13, iOS 27.2: `com.apple.WebKit.WebContent`): its elements come as children of the app with no host view before them, but with frames in screen points already, the right visible flags, the app as parent, and the app's pid as their host application (attribute 65). `Observe` keeps an element of another process whose host application is the app in front, as it is; before, it left the whole page out, and an agent saw the news list only through OCR. Whether a widget's host application is SpringBoard, which would read the same on the home screen, is not checked yet. A hit test (request 6, parameter `point`) answers there with the app's scroll view that holds the page, not with the page's elements.
- Calculator's display has no label or value; its identifier carries the number (`StandardInputView;value:7`), which `Observe` shows as a text element with that value (`text "7"`, identifier `StandardInputView`). The identifier is not in a first push (that element has only its frame, traits and role there), so `Observe` waits up to 1.2 s for the second when a first push leaves an element unnamed; requests wait while the phone builds that push, so asking for the identifier would not be sooner. Calculator's keys are `Key` (20) with the keyboard-key trait, so the keyboard is recognized by its process (many one-character labels), not by that trait.
- The first read after an app opens, measured again in round three (18 launches): act, settle, `Observe` (what the gateway does) took 33–261 ms on Settings and 340–481 ms on Calculator (the wait for the push with the display's number), once 1.07 s; the 2–3 s seen in the second pass did not come back. `Observe` right after `Launch`, without settling, took 0.8–1.6 s: the phone's first answer (the frontmost app) alone took 0.73–0.83 s while the app started, and its push came 1.1–1.6 s after the launch.
- An app that has just launched can show its screen before it lists any element (a walk found only the app element once); `Observe` then waits up to 1.5 s for the push and walks again.
- Request types are the cases of `-[AXPTranslator processTranslatorRequest:]`, which macOS 27 ships with the iOS translator (`AXPTranslator_iOS`): 1 `processApplicationObject:` (parameters `{pid}`: that app's element, in front or not), 2 one attribute, 3 can set, 4 frontmost app, 5 several attributes, 6 `processHitTest:` (parameters `point`, `displayId`, `contextId`), 7 action, 8 set attribute, 9 supported actions, 10 supports attributes, 11 tree dump. Found with lldb on a process that loaded the framework.
- Request type 1 answers for SpringBoard (its element's ID was the same in every session and run) but not for a process without a user interface: asking for a daemon's or the widget renderer's element got no answer within 2 s, which drops the session.
- While Clock is in front, SpringBoard's element has the status bar's items as children (time, signal, Wi-Fi, battery, the location arrow, the "Return to Clock" breadcrumb), all with trait bit 23; nothing of the home screen.
- A second push can say an element is not visible that the walk right after says is ("2 min, two minutes" in Clock's recent timers): that element comes and goes between reads.

### OCR (fallback)

- Vision's accurate recognizer with `zh-Hans`, `zh-Hant`, `en-US`: 0.1–0.4 s per 1125x2436 screenshot once loaded. The first use on a Mac took 56 s (model compile), and runs with automatic language detection sometimes took 15 s, so detection is off.
- Placement matches labels to text in rounds (equal, truncated with an ellipsis, label inside a line, line inside the label) in reading order. Text that appears twice can be matched to the wrong element (a search field whose value equals a result title); elements without visible text (icons, dock apps, images) get no position.
- The on-screen keyboard is detected from OCR (five or more single letters in the lower half) and its keys are dropped from the output.

## iPhones below iOS 27

Built on 2026-11-07. No iPhone below iOS 27 was at hand, so what follows separates what ran somewhere from what is only built to spec.

### What each iOS offers

The developer disk image is one image for every iOS from 17 (Xcode 27.2's `/Library/Developer/DeveloperDiskImages/iOS_DDI`, build 27B52); its daemons are built for iOS 17.0 (`LC_BUILD_VERSION` minos 17.0), and their launchd plists publish the same services on every version. So the question per version is what the phone does when asked.

| Piece | iOS 27 | iOS 17.4 to 26 | iOS 17.0 to 17.3 | iOS 16 and earlier |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tunnel | Lockdown's `CoreDeviceProxy` | The same (added in 17.4) | Not there: remote pairing over QUIC on the phone's USB network interface, which go-ios and pymobiledevice3 do as root (go-ios pauses macOS's `remoted`) | No tunnel; lockdown services |
| Developer services | Pinky mounts Xcode's image as a cryptex (see "Preparing a phone without Xcode") | The same image, as a cryptex or a personalized image | The same image | A `DeveloperDiskImage.dmg` for that exact version; Xcode 27 ships none (its `DeviceSupport` folder is gone), and Pinky will not fetch Apple's images from mirrors |
| Screen stream | `displayservice` | Listed, but refused with CoreDeviceError 9021 (go-ios's measurement). Xcode 27's Device Hub refuses too: its DeviceKit says a device "must be running … or above to screen share" | | |
| HID input | `universalhidservice` | 9021 on iOS 18 (go-ios) | | |
| Screenshots | Instruments, CoreDevice's screen capture | Instruments (`dtservicehub`) | | |
| Elements | `remoteAXService`, with frames | The inspector (`axAuditDaemon.remoteserver`, over lockdown, as the iOS 27 fallback uses), without frames (go-ios on 18.4.1). Whether `remoteAXService` exists before 27 is unknown | | |
| Apps | CoreDevice's app service | The same (iOS 17 and later) | | |
| Lock state | Lockdown's `PasswordProtected` | The same | | |

The daemons check the OS version only against iOS 18 and 26 (`__isPlatformVersionAtLeast` in `dtuhidd`, `dtremotedisplayd`, `dtscreencaptured`, `dtpasteboardd`; `dtdeviceinfod` also checks 27), so the 9021 refusals most likely come from what the OS itself lacks, not from the image. Without HID there is no touch at a point, no keyboard and so no pasting, and no Home; without the stream no live picture. XCTest is the remaining way to touch, which needs a test runner on the phone: WebDriverAgent.

### Two ways, chosen per phone

`pathFor` (`version.go`) picks by version, and the provider by what is on the phone, unless the person chose the connection in Settings › Phones (see "Choosing the connection"):

- **`wda`**, when the WebDriverAgent runner is installed (an app whose bundle id ends in `.xctrunner` and names WebDriverAgentRunner; Pinky's own build would win). Everything works, unlocking from the computer included. `OpenWDA` uses WDA if it already answers (started by Xcode, say), and otherwise starts its test through testmanagerd with go-ios over the tunnel's RSD entry. Pinky reaches WDA's ports, 8100 (HTTP) and 9100 (MJPEG), through usbmuxd, one connection per request: nothing listens on the computer. Requests: `/status`, a session with Pinky's settings, `/source?format=json`, `/screenshot`, W3C `/actions` for taps, long presses, swipes and the mirror's drags, `/wda/keys`, `/element/active` + `/clear`, `/wda/homescreen`, `/wda/pressButton` (Home while unlocking: `/wda/homescreen` brings SpringBoard to the front, which a locked phone refuses), `/wda/apps/activate` (which, unlike `launch`, never restarts a running app), `/wda/activeAppInfo`, `/wda/locked`.
- **`accessibility`**, when it is not: nothing installed, and nothing to act with. The picture is screenshots (one every 100 ms while the screen changes, then one a second), the elements the inspector's walk placed by OCR, apps opened through the app service. Taps, swipes, typing and keys return `unsupported` with a sentence that names the helper: the inspector's only input, its Activate action, pressed nothing on a real phone (see "What ran where"). The provider asks such a phone again every 30 s, so a helper installed meanwhile is picked up.
- iOS 17.0 to 17.3 and 16 and earlier are `needs_setup`, with the reason in the detail.

Both settle by the picture (`settle_frames.go`): WDA's MJPEG frames (15 a second, and a still screen encodes to the same bytes) or screenshots, settled once nothing changed for 250 ms and at least 500 ms passed, as on iOS 27. On the Simulator: 0.52 s on a still screen, 0.93 s after a fling. Both send H.264 encoded by macOS's VideoToolbox (`h264_darwin.go`, purego): Main profile, no B-frames, 2.5 Mbit/s, a key frame first and again after 10 s of a still picture; frames that did not change (same bytes) are skipped, as the phone's own stream does. WDA's MJPEG is the screen at half size, 15 fps, quality 50; `Toucher` scales the mirror's points back up and plays a drag back when the finger lifts, because WDA performs whole gestures. Other systems get `unsupported` for the stream: the gateway and agents still work, but the mirror has no picture. The mirror and the recorder need no change: they take H.264 already.

### What ran where

| What | Where | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| WDA path end to end (`TestWDASim`): home screen, Settings by bundle id, a tap on General and back, typing `Wallpaper` and `蓝牙 é ✓` into Settings' search and clearing it, a screenshot, 3 s of video checked by ffprobe, settling, a mirror drag, the lock state | iOS 18.5 and 26.5 Simulators (iPhone 16 and 17), WebDriverAgent 16.17.6 built by Xcode 27.2 | All pass. Observe 0.5 s (Settings) to 1.5 s (home screen); typing 0.55 to 0.85 s; first video frame after 0.2 to 0.3 s; activating an app 0.8 s (the first Settings launch after the 26.5 Simulator booted took over 30 s) |
| VideoToolbox encoder, frame stream, settling by frames, MJPEG parsing, WDA's tree to elements, the client against a fake WDA, the touch recorder, version paths, provider choices | Unit tests | Pass |
| Starting WDA through testmanagerd over Pinky's tunnel, usbmuxd port forwarding to a phone | Nowhere | Built on go-ios's `RunTestWithConfig` and usbmuxd `Connect`, as `ios ui run wda` does |
| The accessibility path | Its services on the iPhone 13 mini, iOS 27.0.1 (`TestAXProbeDump`, `TestAXProbeActivate`, `TestAXProbeFocusActivate`, device tag); nothing below iOS 27 | Reading works: Calculator's 24 elements in a 0.75 to 1.0 s walk, Settings' 49 in 1.84 s, labels, identifiers and trait words, no frame anywhere. Acting does not: Activate on Calculator's 7 and All Clear returned within 3 to 4 ms without an error and changed nothing on the display (144 before and after), also with the inspector's focus confirmed on the key first. It may act only in apps built for debugging; not tried |
| The WDA path on a phone, chosen in place of CoreDevice (`TestDeviceConnectionWay`, `TestDeviceWDAStart`, `iosctl -connection wda`, device tag) | The iPhone 13 mini, iOS 27.0.1, with the runner the owner had installed for another tool (see "Choosing the connection") | Reading, tapping, Back, typing English and Chinese, screenshots, the live picture, the lock state and unlocking all work; timings in "Choosing the connection". The phone asked for its passcode before the runner's first start after a restart, and again half an hour later |
| iPhone Mirroring with the inspector, for a tree with Mirroring's picture and input | The iPhone 13 mini, iOS 27.0.1, the person locking it and mirroring Settings to this Mac (macOS 27.2) | No tree: while mirrored, the inspector's focus request and remoteAXService timed out, and the app service's process list closed, twice in a row; lockdown said `PasswordProtected` false and the backlight was off. The services still timed out after Mirroring was closed and the phone unlocked: for 8 minutes, through 90 s with no client connected and through another lock and unlock, while the tunnel, display info, HID and screenshots worked. Only restarting the phone brought them back |

What the inspector offers per element, read from its focus messages on iOS 27.0.1: four sections, Basic (Label, Value, Traits, Hint, Identifier, User Input Labels, none settable), Actions (Activate, plus the element's custom actions such as Copy on Calculator's display), Element (class, address, view controller) and Hierarchy (its ancestors). Nothing gives a frame.

Found on the Simulators and handled:

- The edge swipe that is Back on iOS 27 did nothing on the iOS 18.5 Simulator through XCTest, so Back taps the navigation bar's back button when there is one and only otherwise swipes.
- Screenshots are a pixel narrower than points times scale (1178 for 393 points at 3x), so the screenshot's size is the coordinate space, as on iOS 27.
- Settings rows are a Cell holding an accessible Button with the title; only accessibility elements (and text fields and switches) become elements, or every row would show twice.
- The keyboard is a `Keyboard` element with `Key` children in the app's tree; its keys only mark the keyboard as shown. The globe and dictation buttons beside it are listed. iOS 26 shows a one-time tip about sliding to type over the keyboard.
- iOS 26 moved Settings' search to the bottom, with a close button instead of Cancel.

Commands, with WDA built for a simulator (`wda-dd` is any build folder):

```sh
xcodebuild -project WebDriverAgent.xcodeproj -scheme WebDriverAgentRunner \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,id=<sim>' -derivedDataPath wda-dd CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO build-for-testing
TEST_RUNNER_USE_PORT=18100 TEST_RUNNER_MJPEG_SERVER_PORT=19100 xcodebuild test-without-building \
  -xctestrun wda-dd/Build/Products/WebDriverAgentRunner_iphonesimulator*.xctestrun -destination id=<sim>
PINKY_WDA_URL=http://127.0.0.1:18100 PINKY_MJPEG_URL=http://127.0.0.1:19100 \
  go test -tags wdasim -count=1 -v -run TestWDASim ./internal/driver/ios/
/tmp/pinky-iosctl -wda http://127.0.0.1:18100 -mjpeg http://127.0.0.1:19100 observe
```

WDA on a simulator listens on every interface of the computer while it runs; stop it when done. `iosctl` opens a phone below iOS 27 the way Pinky would and runs the commands every path has (observe, tap, swipe, key, type, screenshot, stream, launch, apps, locked).

### Installing the WebDriverAgent helper

Once per phone, on a Mac with Xcode:

1. Get WebDriverAgent: `git clone https://github.com/appium/WebDriverAgent` (Appium's copy works too).
2. Open `WebDriverAgent.xcodeproj`. For the WebDriverAgentRunner target, under Signing & Capabilities, pick your team (a free Apple ID works). If Xcode says the bundle identifier is taken, change its prefix (`com.<you>.WebDriverAgentRunner`), keeping WebDriverAgentRunner in it so Pinky finds it.
3. Pick the iPhone as the destination and run Product › Test once. Xcode installs WebDriverAgentRunner and starts it; with a free Apple ID the phone first asks you to trust the developer in Settings › General › VPN & Device Management. Stop the test once Xcode's log shows `ServerURLHere`.

From then on Pinky starts the helper by itself whenever it opens the phone. With a free Apple ID the signature lasts 7 days, with a paid developer account a year; after that, repeat step 3 (see "When the helper's signature runs out"). The same from a terminal:

```sh
xcodebuild -project WebDriverAgent.xcodeproj -scheme WebDriverAgentRunner \
  -destination id=<udid> -allowProvisioningUpdates DEVELOPMENT_TEAM=<team id> test
```

### When the helper's signature runs out

Built on 2026-11-08 after a user's report. The helper is signed with the person's Apple ID, and the provisioning profile it is signed with runs out: 7 days after Xcode installed it with a free Apple ID, a year with a paid developer account. iOS then no longer starts it, and Pinky used to say only that the helper did not start.

To install it again, plug the iPhone in and repeat step 3 of "Installing the WebDriverAgent helper" (Product › Test, stopped once `ServerURLHere` shows), or run the `xcodebuild … test` command above. Xcode signs the helper anew and installs it over the old one; nothing else changes on the phone. While the phone stays plugged in, Pinky reads the new date within a minute and the reminder goes; a phone that needed setup comes back online within 30 seconds.

What Pinky does (`wda_profile.go`):

- **Reading.** Pinky lists the phone's provisioning profiles with misagent's `CopyAll` (the lockdown service `com.apple.misagent`, over usbmuxd), which only reads. go-ios's `misagent` package sends that request but drops the answer, so Pinky has its own small client. Each profile is a CMS signed message; Pinky takes the property list inside without checking the signature and reads `ExpirationDate`, the `application-identifier` entitlement and `ProvisionedDevices`. It reads BER as well as DER (indefinite lengths, the content in a constructed OCTET STRING), which `encoding/asn1` refuses.
- **Matching.** The helper's profile is one that grants the runner on this phone: its `application-identifier` names the runner's bundle id, or a wildcard (`<team>.*`) covers it, for the runner's team, which is the prefix of the runner's own `application-identifier` in the installation proxy's app list. Of several, the one that runs out last counts: iOS starts the app while any of them lasts, and an old profile stays next to a new one.
- **The date.** `driver.Info.HelperExpires` (new, additive; zero when unknown) carries it for phones driven through the helper, Automatic below iOS 27 or chosen in Settings › Phones. List reads it while inspecting such a phone, again every 30 minutes while the phone is online, and every minute within the reminder (`driver.HelperReminder`, 48 hours), so a helper installed again while the phone stays plugged in is noticed.
- **Once it ran out**, List inspects the phone again and lists it as `needs_setup` with `Setup` `install_helper` (`driver.SetupInstallHelper`, new) and a `Detail` that says when it ran out and how to install it again. The gateway then closes the phone, though a runner already running might have gone on until it ended: Pinky stops at the time it announced. A helper chosen in Settings › Phones but not installed now also gets `install_helper`.
- **A profile Pinky cannot read** changes nothing: the phone works as before, without a reminder. Pinky's log gets each read (`iphone: the helper's provisioning profile`, expires), a change of the date, and a read that failed.
- **The client.** Two days before, the phone's page shows a reminder above the phone: "The helper on <phone> stops working on <day and time>: install it again from Xcode", with How to install it. Once it ran out, the page of the phone that needs setup says so in the same words, with How to install it in place of the steps of Add phone, and Add phone › iPhone shows it too instead of "stuck, retrying". The checkup's `helper` item warns two days before, notes the day when it is further off, and fails with those words once it ran out (`ui/checkup_iphone.go`).

What ran where:

| What | Where | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Reading the profiles and matching the helper's (`TestHelperProfileOnPhone`, read only) | iPhone 13 mini, iOS 27.0.1, 2026-11-08 | 59 profiles in 113 to 127 ms, all parsed (DER). The runner the owner had installed for another tool (bundle id ending in `.wda.xctrunner`) is granted by its team's wildcard profile, "iOS Team Provisioning Profile: *", from a paid account: 365 days, running out on 2027-10-08. The installation proxy's list gave the runner's `application-identifier` |
| BER profiles, matching, the reminder and the expiry in the provider, the checkup item, the client's words and layout | Unit tests (`wda_profile_test.go`, `ui/helper_test.go`), the client's tester in English and Chinese, light and dark | Pass |
| A profile that actually ran out; a free Apple ID's 7-day profile | Not yet | No such phone at hand. Whether iOS keeps an expired profile listed is not seen: if it removes it, Pinky finds no profile and shows the old failure to start |

```sh
PINKY_DEVICE=<udid> scripts/devlock.sh <udid> go test -tags device -count=1 -v -run TestHelperProfileOnPhone ./internal/driver/ios/
PINKY_SCREENSHOTS=<dir> go test ./ui -run TestIPhoneHelperScreenshots
```

### Choosing the connection

Settings › Phones shows each iPhone's connection: Automatic (`pathFor`, as above), CoreDevice (iOS 27 and later, nothing installed) or the WebDriverAgent helper (iOS 17.4 and later, the helper installed). The provider implements `driver.ConnectionChooser`: `Connections` lists the three ways with whether each works on the phone and why not (`os_version`, `not_installed`, `offline`), and `SetConnection` keeps the choice and forgets what List knew of the phone, so the next List inspects it again. The gateway saves the choice in the history store (`device_connections`), gives it to the provider before its first discovery, and on a change takes the phone offline and runs a discovery pass at once: the phone reconnects the chosen way without a restart. A way the phone cannot use leaves it needing setup, with the reason and what to do: the helper chosen but not installed is `Setup` `install_helper`, CoreDevice chosen below iOS 27 is `connection` (`driver.SetupConnection`, `coreDeviceTooOldState`), which the app words in the person's language with Choose the connection, a way to Settings › Phones.

Measured on the iPhone 13 mini, iOS 27.0.1, over USB, both ways (`TestDeviceConnectionWay`, the same steps each way):

| | CoreDevice | WebDriverAgent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Open | 0.7 s | 4 to 5 s: the runner starts each time |
| Read the screen | 0.1 to 0.5 s | Calculator 0.5 to 0.7 s, Settings 1.8 to 2.9 s, the home screen 7.3 s, with a snapshot depth of 30 or 60 alike |
| Tap | 0.06 s | 0.5 to 0.8 s |
| Type `clock`, `你好` | 0.5 to 1.0 s (pasted) | 0.9 s, 1.1 to 1.3 s (XCTest's keyboard) |
| Screenshot | 0.8 s | 0.15 to 0.18 s |
| Live picture | The phone's HEVC display stream: 152 frames in 6 s | WDA's MJPEG (XCTest screenshots, 15 a second at half size), encoded to H.264 on the Mac: 562x1218, the first frame after 0.26 to 0.28 s |
| Calculator's display after 7 | `7` | `Edit field, 7` |
| Unlocking from the computer | Works | Works |
| Banking apps that refuse screen sharing | DBS digibank warned of screen sharing while the stream ran | DBS digibank and China Merchants Bank opened without a warning, the MJPEG picture running |

The banking apps were only opened, with the owner watching: nothing logged in or tapped, no screenshots. For the helper's run Pinky.app was quit, so no CoreDevice stream ran at the same time; DBS's first open while Pinky.app was still streaming had warned. iOS tells apps the screen is shared when it is mirrored or recorded (the display stream counts); XCTest's screenshots are single pictures and most likely do not count.

The passcode for automation:

- Before a UI test runs, iOS asks on the phone for its passcode to allow automation: here before the runner's first start after a restart, and again half an hour later, after the runner had stopped and the phone had been locked and unlocked. XCTest waits up to 60 s for it ("enabling automation mode" in the runner's log). Reports from Apple's forums and Appium say passcode-protected phones ask about once a day; when exactly iOS asks again is not known.
- A passcode entered after the runner gave up still counts: the runner was stopped 2 s into the wait, the owner entered the passcode on the phone, and the next start, three minutes later, did not ask.
- Pinky reads the runner's log for the wait (`runnerLog`). Once it has lasted 5 s (without a request it ends at once), the open returns `errAutomation`. The provider keeps that runner (`wdaWaits`), List reports the phone as needing setup with "Enter the passcode on the iPhone…" (`Setup` `passcode`, `driver.SetupPasscode`, which the app says in the person's words), and once WDA answers List reports it online and the next Open takes the runner over: the gateway no longer starts a runner every discovery pass while the phone waits. When the runner gives up, Pinky waits 2 minutes before starting it again, twice as long after each request in a row nobody answered, up to 30 minutes, and at once after a reconnect or when the person chooses the connection again. On the phone, the request was detected; the takeover and the waits are unit-tested only, and what the runner does once its 60 s are up was not seen.

The phone already had a runner, installed by its owner for another WebDriverAgent tool (iPhone Use; executable `WebDriverAgentRunner-Runner`, bundle id ending in `.wda.xctrunner`, signed with the owner's development certificate). `pickWDARunner` finds runners by bundle id, name or executable, so Pinky used it as it was: nothing was reinstalled or signed again. Pinky starts it with its own environment, so it listens on the phone's loopback only while Pinky runs it (see Security notes); a WDA another tool already runs is used as it is.

Also found:

- Through the helper, `Screen.Keyboard` stays false: on iOS 27 the keys are not in WDA's tree, and XCTest's keyboard query fails on the phone.
- Settings' search field drops out of WDA's tree while results show; typing goes on into it.
- The runner's test log went to Pinky's stderr; it is now read for the passcode wait and dropped (`wdaLog`, tests print it).

### Not done yet

- Nothing below iOS 27 has run on a phone. The first such phone should get, in order: `iosctl devices` (the backend it picks), `TestAXProbeDump`, then `iosctl observe` and `stream` on each path and `tap` with the helper.
- Mirroring a phone that Pinky drives on iOS 27 can leave its accessibility services stuck, so Pinky reads by OCR alone until the phone restarts (seen once, iOS 27.0.1 and macOS 27.2). Pinky does not notice it yet; a check that tells the person to restart the phone would help.
- iPhone Mirroring as a way in: macOS 15 or later, iOS 18 or later, the same Apple Account on both, the phone locked nearby, not in the EU; window capture and mouse and keyboard events would need Screen Recording and Accessibility for Pinky. With no tree from the phone while it mirrors (above), it would read the screen by OCR alone, as DESIGN.md's planned Mirroring backend does; not built.
- `Waker` through the helper; `Unlock` wakes the phone by itself.
- Installing and re-signing the helper from Pinky (the "Install the Pinky helper" choice in Add phone): a person does it in Xcode for now, and Pinky reminds them before the signature runs out ("When the helper's signature runs out"). go-ios can sign with a certificate and profile (`ios/signing`), which would make it possible without Xcode.
- The picture below iOS 27 on Windows and Linux (no encoder Pinky can call without cgo).
- Landscape on both paths.

## Preparing a phone without Xcode

Built on 2026-11-08. Before, Pinky needed Xcode for two steps: showing the Developer Mode switch (iOS hides it until a developer tool has seen the phone) and mounting the developer disk image (Xcode's Devices window did it; below iOS 27 nothing did it again after the phone restarted). Now Pinky does both. What remains of Xcode is the image itself, which Pinky does not ship.

| Step | Before | Now |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Trusting the computer | The system asks: macOS when a phone is plugged in, Linux's usbmuxd too | The same on macOS and Linux. On Windows, where nothing else may ask, Pinky asks the phone itself (go-ios `Pair`) while it has no pair record, at most every 4 s |
| The Developer Mode switch | Xcode reveals it when it sees the phone | Pinky sends AMFI's reveal (`com.apple.amfi.lockdown`, action 0) once per attach while Developer Mode is off. The person turns it on, the phone restarts and asks them to confirm. Pinky never confirms for them (AMFI's action 2 would): that question is the person's |
| The developer disk image | Xcode mounts it. Below iOS 27 a restart drops it and nothing mounts it again until Xcode runs; iOS 27 keeps it (seen on 27.0.1) | Pinky mounts it in the background whenever the developer services are missing (see below): below iOS 27 after every restart, on any iOS when another tool took it off. |
| The tunnel | Pinky's own (lockdown's CoreDeviceProxy, userspace) | Unchanged |

### Where the image comes from

`findDiskImage` (`ddi.go`) looks, in order, in `PINKY_DDI` (an `iOS_DDI` folder or the `Restore` folder in one; when set, the only place), in Pinky's folder (`DeveloperDiskImages/iOS_DDI` in its data folder: `~/Library/Application Support/Pinky` on macOS, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Pinky` on Windows, `~/.local/share/pinky` on Linux), and on macOS in Xcode's `/Library/Developer/DeveloperDiskImages/iOS_DDI`. Xcode installs that folder the first time it is opened (from its `MobileDeviceDevelopment` package), and it stays when Xcode is deleted. The newest image wins, by cryptex version, then by Xcode build; a folder missing a file its manifest names is skipped.

Apple serves Xcode 27's image only inside Xcode, from the App Store or the developer site, both behind an Apple Account sign-in; `devicectl manage ddis update` copies from an installed Xcode and downloads nothing. Apple's public CDN has older images inside device-support packages (Xcode 16.2 and 26.0.x), which most likely lack the services iOS 27's path uses. The mirrors other tools use are third-party copies: pymobiledevice3 downloads github.com/doronz88/DeveloperDiskImage (Xcode 27.0 beta 4, 27A5228h, files renamed, so not Apple's files byte for byte) and go-ios deviceboxhq.com (Xcode 26.4 beta, no cryptex). Xcode's license forbids redistributing Apple's software.

The owner chose to offer the first mirror as a last resort (`mirror.go`), on these terms: only when no official copy is on the computer, only when the person clicks Download in Add phone, with every file pinned, the source named on screen as a third-party copy of Apple's files, a clear message when it fails or a file differs, and Pinky hosting and shipping nothing of Apple's. So:

- The files come from one commit of the mirror (`e2aaeac8…`), from raw.githubusercontent.com, and each must have the size and SHA-256 Pinky pins, or the download stops with `driver.ErrDiskImageMismatch` and nothing is kept. An earlier download stays until a new one is complete.
- The mirror keeps the image's two halves apart under new names (the cryptex, and the personalized image that iOS before 27 mounts). Pinky puts them back together under the names the cryptex half's manifest gives them (`022-22070-072.dmg` and its trust cache for the personalized half), in `DeveloperDiskImages/iOS_DDI-mirror` in its data folder, with a `version.plist` that says where they came from. The manifest's SHA-384 digests match the assembled files for every chip iOS 17 runs on; the 18 identities that differ (A8 and A9 chips, which no iOS 17 runs on) differ the same way in Apple's own 27B52 manifest.
- `findDiskImage` takes that folder only when it finds no official copy.
- The image is a beta (27A5228h, cryptex version 27.1.5228.8, older than 27B52's 27.2.52.0). Decompressed, its cryptex has the same developer daemons as 27B52's (`dtremotedisplayd`, `dtuhidd`, `dtpasteboardd`, `dtdeviceinfod`, each the same number of times). Whether a phone mounts it and offers everything from it has not been tried.
- The download is about 32 MB. Pinky asks for nothing else from the mirror, and sends only a plain `User-Agent: Pinky`.

Clients reach it through `driver.DiskImageDownloader` (the iOS provider) and the gateway's `DiskImageMirror` and `DownloadDiskImage`; Add phone shows it under the official ways when a phone waits with `Setup` "no_disk_image".

### The mount

- It starts when `List` finds the services Pinky checks for missing (the screen stream and HID on iOS 27, instruments below), in the background, one at a time per phone, once the phone is unlocked: a locked phone mounts nothing (CoreDevice refuses too, "the device was still locked"), and installing a cryptex on one waits instead of failing, so Pinky reads lockdown's `PasswordProtected` (and the iOS version) first and asks for the phone to be unlocked. While the image is being installed Pinky looks at the lock every 2 s, and a phone that locks stops the mount at once, reported as locked: go-ios would otherwise wait for the locked phone until the mount's timeout. Meanwhile the phone is `needs_setup` with `Setup` "preparing"; when the mount ends the provider forgets the phone and looks at it again at once.
- `mountDiskImage` takes one way per phone, by its iOS (`mountWay`), as pymobiledevice3 does: iOS 27 and later get the image as a cryptex through cryptexd (`com.apple.security.cryptexd.remote`), as Xcode 27 installed it on the test phone; that is also the only way for models newer than the personalized identities of 27B52's manifest list (up to iPhone18,5, the iPhone 17 family), such as the iPhone 18 Pro. Earlier iOS gets the personalized image through the image mounter (Xcode 15's way). There is no second way after a failure: the first version tried the personalized image after a cryptex install gave up, in the background, which could only leave an iOS 27 phone with an image Xcode would not put there. Either way Apple's signing server (gs.apple.com) signs the image's digests for this phone with a nonce the phone made, through go-ios, and the phone checks that signature, so only Apple's own image mounts. Each mount sends the phone's ECID and chip identifiers to Apple, as Xcode does.
- It keeps what is there: a cryptex of the same version is left alone (nothing is signed or sent), an older one is replaced, a newer one is left alone and reported. A personalized image that is not this one is replaced: Pinky gets there only when the services are missing.
- After mounting it waits up to 10 s for the services. If they do not come, it says whether the image is older than the phone's iOS (then Xcode needs updating) or asks for a restart of the phone.
- A mount gives up after 90 s. A failed mount is tried again by what went wrong: a locked phone after 3 s (`Setup` "unlock": a phone that just restarted mounts nothing until it is unlocked once), no image after 10 s ("no_disk_image", with where to get one), no network after 20 s, other errors after 30 s. What trying again cannot fix (the signing server refuses, the image does not know the phone, a newer image on the phone, services missing after a mount) waits 10 minutes or until the phone reconnects. A restart is a new usbmuxd attach, which starts over.
- `List` asks a phone that waits for a step again sooner than other phones that are not online: every 2 s while it waits for Trust, every 3 s while it is being prepared or must be unlocked, so Add phone moves on soon after the person's step.
- The developer services are checked once per usbmuxd attach, so a phone that reconnects or restarts is always looked at again, and every minute while a phone is online (`recheckOnline`): an image taken off while the cable stays in is mounted again. A failed look keeps the phone online; only services seen missing count. A CoreDevice `Open` that fails forgets the phone, so the next `List` looks again. Before 2026-11-08 (2026.1108.7) an online phone was looked at only when it reconnected, and a "services there" result was reused for 5 minutes across reconnects.
- Each step goes to Pinky's log (`Provider.Log`): `iphone: mounting the developer disk image` (image, folder), `iphone: developer disk image ready` (way, kept, replaced, took), `iphone: could not mount the developer disk image` (way, took, err, retry_in), `iphone: the developer services went away`, the Developer Mode switch, the trust request on Windows and the mirror download.
- **The cryptex install on iOS 27.0.1** needed three fixes (2026-11-08, iPhone 13 mini; "What ran where"). Before them every install waited until the mount's 90 s timeout, the phone unlocked, while Apple's devicectl installed the same image in half a second.
  1. go-ios's `installCryptex` waited on each payload's stream for the phone's FileOpenReply before it wrote the payload (`xpc.FileTransferStream.WaitAccepted`). cryptexd sends that reply only after the payload. Pinky mounts with a copy of go-ios's cryptex code that sends each payload at once (`internal/driver/ios/cryptex`, MIT, its README says what changed); pymobiledevice3, written from devicectl's traffic, does the same and notes that a device resets a stream held open waiting for the reply. A fake cryptexd that behaves this way shows go-ios's install waiting forever and the copy installing.
  2. Pinky closed the RSD connection right after announcing the host, sometimes before the phone took the announcement, which left the tunnel a legacy peer's (see "Tunnel"). Fixed with `rsdLinger`.
  3. The upload stalled after the first full-size packets with the tunnel's 16000 MTU (see "Tunnel"). The mount's tunnel asks for 1280 (`uploadMTU`).
  With all three, Pinky's provider mounted Xcode's 27B52 in 1.4 s after the image had been taken off, and the phone was online again 2.3 s after the take-off.

### Steps for clients

`driver.Info.Setup` (new, additive) names the step a phone waits for: `trust`, `developer_mode`, `unlock`, `preparing`, `no_disk_image`, `disk_image` (the mount failed; `Detail` says why), `update` (iOS too old), `install_helper` (the helper is missing, or its signature ran out: see "When the helper's signature runs out") `passcode` (iOS asks for the passcode before the helper may control the phone: see "The passcode for automation") and `connection` (the connection chosen in Settings › Phones does not work with the phone: see "Choosing the connection"). `Detail` still says it in a sentence. Add phone › iPhone (`ui/addiphone.go`) shows them as numbered steps, each saying what to do on the phone, and the reason when one is stuck; the Phone screen of an iPhone that needs setup links to them. The steps replace the pairing-code form, which no iPhone used.

### The computer

Every connection to an iPhone goes through usbmuxd. macOS has it built in. Windows gets it with Apple's iPhone driver, from the Apple Devices app (Microsoft Store) or iTunes. Linux gets it from the `usbmuxd` package, whose daemon udev starts while an iPhone is plugged in, so at Pinky's launch it is often not running. Before, Pinky left iPhones out for the whole run when usbmuxd did not answer at launch; now the provider always starts, `List` returns no phones while usbmuxd is missing (once it has listed phones, the first two failures in a row are errors instead, so a hiccup does not drop them from the gateway), and `CheckHost` (`driver.HostChecker`, through the gateway's `HostChecks`) says what is missing: `apple_devices` (Windows), `usbmuxd` (Linux, not installed) or `usbmuxd_stopped` (Linux, installed but not running). `pinkyctl devices` prints it too.

### Checkup

iPhones answer the checkup page (`driver.Checker`, `checkup.go`), reading only: no taps, no keys, no settings, nothing mounted.

| Item | How it is checked | When it fails or warns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `developer_mode` | The image mounter's `QueryDeveloperModeStatus` | Fix `developer_mode` |
| `disk_image` | What the phone has mounted (cryptexd's list, else the image mounter's), the services the path needs (screen and HID on CoreDevice, `legacyReady`'s below iOS 27), and whether this computer has an image to mount again should it go missing (`findDiskImage` in Pinky's folder, Xcode's, the download) | Fails with fix `disk_image` when the services are missing; warns with `no_disk_image` when nothing here could mount it again |
| `helper` | WebDriverAgent's `/status`, on the helper's path, and when its signature runs out, read afresh; without the helper it fails | Fix `install_helper`; warns two days before the signature runs out, and once it ran out fails, or warns while the helper still runs |
| `screen` | A screenshot | Fix `screenshot` |
| `input` | CoreDevice: the HID service accepts a connection, which is closed again without an event (any event would reach the phone). Without the helper: fails | Fix `install_helper` below iOS 27 |

The gateway puts the connection items first; for an iPhone that is not online, the `authorized` item's fix is its `Setup` step, which the client puts into the same words as Add phone's steps, with a button to them (`ui/checkup_iphone.go`).

### What ran where

| What | Where | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Finding the image | This Mac, Xcode 27.2 | Xcode's 27B52, cryptex version 27.2.52.0 |
| How the phone has its image (`TestDiskImageStatus`, read only) | iPhone 13 mini, iOS 27.0.1 | Developer Mode on, cryptexd offered, one cryptex `com.apple.MobileAsset.DDI` 27.2.52.0 (this Mac's image), no personalized image |
| Pinky's mount on a phone that has the image (`TestDiskImageMountKeeps`) | The same | Kept as it is in 7 ms: no signing request, no upload, the same cryptex afterwards |
| Taking the image off and letting the provider mount it again, as after a restart (`TestDiskImageRemount`, with the owner's leave) | iPhone 13 mini, 2026-11-08 | Taking it off worked (3 s). Then every cryptex install (the provider's, its retry and the test's own clean-up) waited until its 3-minute timeout: the phone was locked (Apple's devicectl refused at once, "the device was still locked", and read `passcodeRequired` true). go-ios's install waits for the phone to accept each file before it reads the install's reply, so a refusal makes it wait instead of fail. Afterwards the phone listed 64 services instead of 85: no image at all. Instruments (`dtservicehub`) and `remoteAXService` were still listed because iOS 27 offers them itself: neither is in the image (Xcode 27.2's cryptex and personalized images, attached read only on the Mac, publish `displayservice`, `universalhidservice`, `screencaptureservice`, `pasteboardservice` and `deviceinfo` from `/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.coredevice.*.plist`, and nothing else Pinky uses). So none of Pinky's mounts put anything on the phone, and the personalized try in the background did not either: both images carry the screen and HID daemons. Pinky now checks the lock first and watches it during the mount. The coordinating session put the image back with `devicectl` once the phone was unlocked. On an unlocked phone the install waits too (two rows down) |
| The checkup (`TestCheckupOnPhone`, read only) | iPhone 13 mini, iOS 27.0.1, 2026-11-08, after the image was put back | All four items pass in 1.0 s: Developer Mode on; the image 27.2.52.0 mounted as a cryptex, and Xcode's 27B52 here to mount again; a 1125×2436 screenshot; the HID service answers (no event sent) |
| A restart, Pinky.app 2026.1108.7 running, Xcode quit (read only) | iPhone 13 mini, iOS 27.0.1, 2026-11-08 11:13 | The phone came back with the cryptex 27.2.52.0 already there: Pinky opened it 52 s after boot (launchd's start in the process list), though nothing on the Mac mounted it (no mount in CoreDeviceService's log, no lookup of Apple's signing server by any process). iOS 27 keeps the cryptex image across restarts |
| Pinky.app's own mount: the image taken off (3 s) and the cable plugged in again, the phone unlocked, with the owner's leave | iPhone 13 mini, iOS 27.0.1, 2026-11-08 11:43 | While the cable stayed in, Pinky.app did not notice for 2 minutes (it looked at online phones only when they reconnected; now every minute). Plugged in again, it saw the services missing in 11 s and mounted Xcode's 27B52 the cryptex way: three tries, each waiting until its 90 s timeout. cryptexd's log: the request and five file streams arrived, then nothing for 31 s until the connection closed ("image file transfer: Broken pipe" for all five). devicectl then mounted the image in 2.5 s, and Pinky showed the phone online 3 s later |
| Finding why the install hung (with the owner's leave; the image taken off and put back with devicectl each time) | iPhone 13 mini, iOS 27.0.1, 2026-11-08 13:25 to 13:59 | Sending the payloads at once alone: still waits. The phone's syslog: cryptexd said "Invalid or missing remote device connection version flags" on the tunnels where remoted had logged "Device must renegotiate TLS" (the RSD connection closed too soon); with the RSD connection kept open every tunnel got its flags, and the install still stalled after 1,047,632 bytes of the image. The tunnel's counters: after the first 27 full-size packets nothing came back from the phone, gVisor retransmitted 7 times, and the phone's TCP timed out after 18 s. The goroutines: the tunnel's reader waiting on the network, its writer idle. Once at 13:46 Apple's signing server failed TLS with an expired certificate, through this Mac's proxy; a few minutes later it was valid again |
| Pinky's own mount, all three fixes (with the owner's leave) | iPhone 13 mini, iOS 27.0.1, 2026-11-08 14:03 and 14:06 | `mountOn`: the image (17.2 MB) in 0.5 s, installed 6.7 s after the start. The provider, as the gateway runs it, after the image was taken off: missing services seen in 0.2 s, "iphone: developer disk image ready" way=cryptex took=1.418s, online again 2.3 s after the take-off; then the checkup, all four items pass |
| The home screen's tree after the restart (read only) | iPhone 13 mini, iOS 27.0.1, 2026-11-08 11:53 | "Home Screen" (SpringBoard), 25 elements from the tree, no OCR, 0.56 s; no "no frontmost app" |
| Downloading the mirror's image (`TestDownloadMirrorLive`) | This Mac, from GitHub | 32 MB in 37 s, every file matched its pin, the assembled image read as 27A5228h, cryptex version 27.1.5228.8 |
| The Developer Mode switch | Not yet | The test phone has Developer Mode on, and turning it off is not allowed |
| Pairing on Windows; usbmuxd on Windows and Linux | Not yet | Unit tests only |
| The steps in Add phone | The client's tester, light and dark, English and Chinese | Each step and each stuck case drawn and checked |

## What does not work yet

- Elements scrolled out of view are not listed (the phone lists what is on screen); agents scroll and observe again.
- Other processes' elements without a host view are left out unless the phone names the app in front as their host (web pages in apps). A home screen widget's host is not checked yet.
- Elements behind a sheet can be listed with the sheet's (Settings' search).
- The pushed-tree rules trust timing: two inputs less than about 0.3 s apart (faster than the pacing rule allows) could still get the first one's push.
- While Pinky is connected the phone's accessibility runtime is on and it pushes a tree after every change: up to 1.7 MB (home screen) over the tunnel each time.
- Landscape: touch mapping, element frames and the screen size assume portrait.
- A pasteboard the phone does not let anyone read (a Universal Clipboard item, a password, transient content) cannot be saved; `Type` empties it after pasting. When reading every representation stalls, only each item's first one is put back. Restored contents stay on the phone (no Universal Clipboard) and carry Pinky's source metadata.
- Typing by keys (only without the pasteboard service): ASCII, the first letter capitalized by Latin keyboards, 4–5 s per call with a keyboard switch (each probe walks the tree, slowly while the phone pushes one).
- Wi-Fi: works but slow and lossy (above); `Wireless` stays off.
- `Unlock` unlocked the iPhone 13 mini on 2026-11-08 (ios-older's test, the owner typing the passcode). Swiping again when the first swipe brings no passcode pad (a lock screen full of notifications, field test item 17) is unit-tested only: `TestDeviceLockScreenPad`, which types nothing, found the pad in 1.2 s on a lock screen already showing it. Lock detection for phones without a passcode is not tested.
- SpringBoard's alerts and banners as events, the app beneath Face ID's prompt and `not_in_screenshot` were checked on quiet screens only (no false events, names or marks); a real banner, a real Face ID prompt and a real capture-proof layer have not been seen by this code.
- Banking apps that refuse to run while the screen is shared cannot be used by agents: the stream must run for input. They work for the person 30 s after the last view or input.
- iOS 17.4 to 26 is built but not tried on a phone (see "iPhones below iOS 27"); 17.3 and earlier are not supported. Windows and Linux cross-compile, untested.
- Instruments (`com.apple.instruments.dtservicehub`) is not in Xcode 27.2's developer disk image, and iOS 27 lists it without one, so its presence does not show that an image is mounted. The check below iOS 27 (`probeLegacyServices`) therefore also wants one of the services the image itself publishes (display, HID, screen capture, pasteboard or device info). Not checked on a phone below iOS 27.
- The image downloaded from the mirror, the Developer Mode switch and pairing on Windows are built but not yet tried on a phone (see "Preparing a phone without Xcode"). A computer without Xcode's image (a Mac that never had Xcode, Windows, Linux) needs a copy from a Mac with Xcode, or the mirror's beta image.
- `WaitSettled` uses frame sizes (and accessibility notifications when they come); animated widgets keep it from ever settling on such home screens (it times out), and after motion the encoder's slowly falling bitrate can keep it waiting a little after the picture stopped.

## What the owner should try

Done on 2026-11-08 for unlocking, both ways: the owner locked the iPhone 13 mini, ran `iosctl -connection coredevice unlock` and `iosctl -connection wda unlock` and typed the passcode in their own terminal, and the phone unlocked each time (steps 1 and 4; `unlock` woke the screen itself). Steps 2, 3 and 5 were not run; no wrong passcode was tried. Through the helper, the first try typed nothing and failed: `/wda/homescreen` is refused while the phone is locked, so Home is now `/wda/pressButton`. For another phone: with the iPhone connected by USB and nobody else using it:

1. Lock it with the side button and leave it until the screen is dark.
2. `scripts/devlock.sh <udid> /tmp/pinky-iosctl -udid <udid> screen` should print `screen on: false`, and `locked` should print `locked: true`.
3. `wake` should light the screen on the lock screen (Home, as a keyboard's Home key would), and `screen` then print `true`.
4. `unlock`, then type the passcode and Enter: it should print `unlocked` within a few seconds, the phone showing its home screen or last app. Watch the phone: the passcode pad should come up after the swipe and fill one key at a time.
5. Once more with a wrong passcode: it should fail with "device locked" after one attempt (the phone counts one failed attempt) and type nothing more.

If the pad does not come up after the swipe (the phone may want Home instead with a keyboard attached), `unlock` stops with "the passcode pad did not appear" and has typed nothing. If the phone accepts the passcode but `unlock` still fails, lockdown's lock state is slow to change and `unlockWait` (4 s) needs raising.

## Security notes

- WebDriverAgent serves its HTTP and MJPEG ports on every interface of the phone by default, Wi-Fi included: anyone on the same network could drive the phone through it, past Pinky's approvals. When Pinky starts the helper it sets `USE_IP=127.0.0.1`, so both listen only on the phone's loopback, where usbmuxd's connections arrive. A WDA that is already running when Pinky opens the phone (started from Xcode or Appium) is used as it is, with whatever binding it has: stop it after installing (step 3 of "Installing the WebDriverAgent helper") so Pinky starts its own.

- While a session runs, the tunnel's forwarder listens on 127.0.0.1 and lets any local process reach the phone's developer services through it (go-ios's own userspace tunnel does the same). It adds nothing an agent with shell access could not already do through usbmuxd, which the threat model covers, but the gateway's isolation advice applies to it too.
- Media streams make the phone show its screen-sharing indicator and block its camera and microphone; `Close` stops the stream, and the phone also stops it by itself 10 s after receiver reports stop (a crashed process).
- The virtual keyboard and any held finger are released on `Close`. A killed process cannot release them; the phone should drop them when the HID connection closes with the tunnel, but that is not tested.
- `Type` holds the person's pasteboard in memory for one call, never logs it, and its writes stay on the phone (`localOnly`). A process killed between the SET and the restore leaves the typed text on the pasteboard, and the saved contents are lost with the process.
- `Unlock` keeps the passcode only for the call and never logs it; it types it only while lockdown says locked and the passcode pad is on screen, so a Face ID unlock on the way cannot send it to an app. `iosctl unlock` reads it from standard input, not the command line.

## Notes for other sessions

- `go.mod` gains go-ios (main), gVisor and purego; expect a merge in `go.mod`/`go.sum`.
- No shared contract changed by this driver; it follows 5e83552 (Toucher points in video pixels).
- For the gateway and the client: `Stream` packets are HEVC Annex B; a `Config` packet (VPS, SPS, PPS) comes before every keyframe a subscriber receives; PTS counts from the stream's start on a 24 kHz clock. A new subscriber waits up to about 100 ms for a requested keyframe. No frames come while the screen is still (from about 7 s after the last change), so the mirror keeps showing the last frame and recordings have gaps. Element bounds and taps are screenshot pixels (1125x2436 here); raw touches are video pixels (1136x2464), which on iPhone are the same numbers inside the screen. The video's right 11 columns and bottom 28 rows are black padding; a mirror can crop the picture to the `Screen`'s width and height.
- `Open` connects `remoteAXService` in the background, which turns on the phone's accessibility runtime for the session (no visible change on the phone), the pasteboard service and the inspector session (for apps coming to the foreground), and reads the app catalog.
- The device's video stream stops 30 s after the last `Stream` view closed and the last input, and starts again for the next view or input (see Decisions); a view open all along (the mirror, a recording) keeps it running.
- iPhone screens can now carry events (`dialog`, `notification`, `toast`, from SpringBoard; see Decisions) and two states of the driver's own: `adjustable` (a vertical swipe changes it: picker wheels, sliders) and `not_in_screenshot` (the screenshot, and so the mirror, does not show it). The provider caches its inspections (see Decisions).
- `Type` takes any text and leaves the pasteboard as it was (see Decisions for the cases it cannot). `Waker`: `ScreenOn` is quick (one CoreDevice request); `Wake` presses Home only on a dark screen. `Unlocker` follows the contract: one attempt, `ErrLocked` when the phone stays locked (or the passcode pad never showed, with nothing typed), `ErrUnsupported` for a passcode the keyboard cannot type. `Open` honours `Info.Connection == "wifi"`.
- `WaitSettled` returns no sooner than 500 ms after the call, once the last 250 ms brought frames of one size, or no frames while the stream is alive; a fling in a list takes 2–3 s to stop, and animated widgets never stop.
- During testing `iosctl devices` probed every phone usbmuxd listed, which included the owner's iPad (iPad13,4, over Wi-Fi): one tunnel and one RSD handshake, nothing else.
- The phone was left on its home screen; Settings was only browsed (back navigation, scrolling, searches for "wallpaper" and "clock" that were cancelled, and closed again through the close button). Once a test's cleanup tap landed on a search result and opened Settings > Apps > Clock; nothing there was touched (its Mobile Data switch stayed on), and the test no longer taps after typing. Calculator was left cleared.
- Round three: the phone's pasteboard held a Universal Clipboard item, which the phone does not let anyone read, so it could not be kept; the typing tests set their own pasteboard contents and leave it empty. The keyboard was switched to English (UK) and back to Pinyin by the keys test; it was left on Pinyin. The phone stayed unlocked and awake throughout; nothing was locked, no passcode typed, no setting changed.
- The on-screen keyboard check from OCR needs single letters spread across the screen: a list's alphabetical section index (Settings > Apps) fooled the first version.
- `driver.ConnectionChooser` is new and optional (additive): the iOS provider implements it, and the gateway's `Connections` and `SetConnection` serve Settings › Phones. The choice lives in the history store's `device_connections` table (schema 3).
- With the helper, Pinky sees the phone's passcode request for automation in the runner's log and lists the phone as needing setup until it is answered (see "Choosing the connection"); an agent gets that detail when it opens the phone meanwhile.
